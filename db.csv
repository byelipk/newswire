For all you political junkies out there, you’re probably aware that there was a presidential election last night. The Republican candidate – Donald Trump – emerged the winner, but some people (like millions of them) are kind of terrified by this result.
Perhaps that explains why filmmaker Michael Moore’s Facebook post today is currently going crazy viral. His “Morning After To-Do List” is a challenge to citizens to reject fear and embrace the power we all have to get out there and actually do something that matters. 
You can read the transcript of his post below or view it directly here :  
Morning After To-Do List:
1. Take over the Democratic Party and return it to the people. They have failed us miserably.
2. Fire all pundits, predictors, pollsters and anyone else in the media who had a narrative they wouldn't let go of and refused to listen to or acknowledge what was really going on. Those same bloviators will now tell us we must ""heal the divide"" and “come together.” They will pull more hooey like that out of their ass in the days to come. Turn them off.
3. Any Democratic member of Congress who didn’t wake up this morning ready to fight, resist and obstruct in the way Republicans did against President Obama every day for eight full years must step out of the way and let those of us who know the score lead the way in stopping the meanness and the madness that's about to begin.
4. Everyone must stop saying they are “stunned” and “shocked.” What you mean to say is that you were in a bubble and weren’t paying attention to your fellow Americans and their despair. YEARS of being neglected by both parties, the anger and the need for revenge against the system only grew. Along came a TV star they liked whose plan was to destroy both parties and tell them all “You're fired!” Trump’s victory is no surprise. He was never a joke. Treating him as one only strengthened him. He is both a creature and a creation of the media and the media will never own that.
5. You must say this sentence to everyone you meet today: “HILLARY CLINTON WON THE POPULAR VOTE!” The MAJORITY of our fellow Americans preferred Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Period. Fact. If you woke up this morning thinking you live in an effed-up country, you don’t. The majority of your fellow Americans wanted Hillary, not Trump. The only reason he’s president is because of an arcane, insane 18th-century idea called the Electoral College. Until we change that, we’ll continue to have presidents we didn’t elect and didn’t want. You live in a country where a majority of its citizens have said they believe there’s climate change, they believe women should be paid the same as men, they want a debt-free college education, they don’t want us invading countries, they want a raise in the minimum wage and they want a single-payer true universal health care system. None of that has changed. We live in a country where the majority agree with the “liberal” position. We just lack the liberal leadership to make that happen (see: #1 above). Let's try to get this all done by noon today. -- Michael Moore

Republican Donald Trump became the US president-elect early Wednesday morning, a   result that surprised many as most polls had given Democrat Hillary Clinton a greater   chance of winning even as the race tightened.
Now that a Trump presidency is imminent, however, people on   Twitter — especially Muslim-Americans and Latinos — are reporting   hate speech and hate crimes they're attributing to Trump   supporters.
Shaun King , a   reporter for the New York Daily News, on Wednesday began writing   on Twitter about instances of hate speech people said they had   experienced. You can see a few recent ones below.

Insanul Ahmed, a senior editor at the music website Genius, made   another list, a Twitter Moments compilation , called ""Day 1 in Trump's   America."" On Wednesday, the list updated every few minutes with   new tweets describing what Ahmed described as ""racist episodes   POC are facing now that Trump is our President Elect.""

A Medium post compiling similar reports, also called ""Day 1   in Trump's America,"" was published Wednesday by Verge reporter   and photographer Sean O'Kane.
The post's leading photo shows graffiti on a softball dugout wall   that says ""Make America White Again"" and is next to a swastika.   The photo was taken Wednesday by Brian Quinn, a journalist from the   Wellsville Daily Reporter in Wellsville, New York.

O'Kane linked to a story from The Syracuse Post-Standard, which reported that vandals burned rainbow flags (a symbol of the   LGBT-rights movement) hanging from homes in western New York.
News outlets including Quartz and The Washington Post have started to report on similar issues   as well, and the Southern   Poverty Law Center is asking for people to send reports their   way.",0
