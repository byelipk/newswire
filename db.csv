The Republican candidate \xE2\x80\x93 Donald Trump \xE2\x80\x93 emerged the winner, but some people (like millions of them) are kind of terrified by this result.Perhaps that explains why filmmaker Michael Moore\xE2\x80\x99s Facebook post today is currently going crazy viral. His \xE2\x80\x9CMorning After To-Do List\xE2\x80\x9D is a challenge to citizens to reject fear and embrace the power we all have to get out there and actually do something that matters.\xC2\xA0You can read the transcript of his post below or view it directly here: \xC2\xA0Morning After To-Do List:1. Take over the Democratic Party and return it to the people. They have failed us miserably.2. Fire all pundits, predictors, pollsters and anyone else in the media who had a narrative they wouldn't let go of and refused to listen to or acknowledge what was really going on. Those same bloviators will now tell us we must \"heal the divide\" and \xE2\x80\x9Ccome together.\xE2\x80\x9D They will pull more hooey like that out of their ass in the days to come. Turn them off.3. Any Democratic member of Congress who didn\xE2\x80\x99t wake up this morning ready to fight, resist and obstruct in the way Republicans did against President Obama every day for eight full years must step out of the way and let those of us who know the score lead the way in stopping the meanness and the madness that's about to begin.4. Everyone must stop saying they are \xE2\x80\x9Cstunned\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cshocked.\xE2\x80\x9D What you mean to say is that you were in a bubble and weren\xE2\x80\x99t paying attention to your fellow Americans and their despair. YEARS of being neglected by both parties, the anger and the need for revenge against the system only grew. Along came a TV star they liked whose plan was to destroy both parties and tell them all \xE2\x80\x9CYou're fired!\xE2\x80\x9D Trump\xE2\x80\x99s victory is no surprise. He was never a joke. Treating him as one only strengthened him. He is both a creature and a creation of the media and the media will never own that.5. You must say this sentence to everyone you meet today: \xE2\x80\x9CHILLARY CLINTON WON THE POPULAR VOTE!\xE2\x80\x9D The MAJORITY of our fellow Americans preferred Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Period. Fact. If you woke up this morning thinking you live in an effed-up country, you don\xE2\x80\x99t. The majority of your fellow Americans wanted Hillary, not Trump. The only reason he\xE2\x80\x99s president is because of an arcane, insane 18th-century idea called the Electoral College. Until we change that, we\xE2\x80\x99ll continue to have presidents we didn\xE2\x80\x99t elect and didn\xE2\x80\x99t want. You live in a country where a majority of its citizens have said they believe there\xE2\x80\x99s climate change, they believe women should be paid the same as men, they want a debt-free college education, they don\xE2\x80\x99t want us invading countries, they want a raise in the minimum wage and they want a single-payer true universal health care system. None of that has changed. We live in a country where the majority agree with the \xE2\x80\x9Cliberal\xE2\x80\x9D position. We just lack the liberal leadership to make that happen (see: #1 above).
