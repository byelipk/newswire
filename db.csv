For all you political junkies out there, you’re probably aware that there was a presidential election last night. The Republican candidate – Donald Trump – emerged the winner, but some people (like millions of them) are kind of terrified by this result.
Perhaps that explains why filmmaker Michael Moore’s Facebook post today is currently going crazy viral. His “Morning After To-Do List” is a challenge to citizens to reject fear and embrace the power we all have to get out there and actually do something that matters. 
You can read the transcript of his post below or view it directly here :  
Morning After To-Do List:
1. Take over the Democratic Party and return it to the people. They have failed us miserably.
2. Fire all pundits, predictors, pollsters and anyone else in the media who had a narrative they wouldn't let go of and refused to listen to or acknowledge what was really going on. Those same bloviators will now tell us we must ""heal the divide"" and “come together.” They will pull more hooey like that out of their ass in the days to come. Turn them off.
3. Any Democratic member of Congress who didn’t wake up this morning ready to fight, resist and obstruct in the way Republicans did against President Obama every day for eight full years must step out of the way and let those of us who know the score lead the way in stopping the meanness and the madness that's about to begin.
4. Everyone must stop saying they are “stunned” and “shocked.” What you mean to say is that you were in a bubble and weren’t paying attention to your fellow Americans and their despair. YEARS of being neglected by both parties, the anger and the need for revenge against the system only grew. Along came a TV star they liked whose plan was to destroy both parties and tell them all “You're fired!” Trump’s victory is no surprise. He was never a joke. Treating him as one only strengthened him. He is both a creature and a creation of the media and the media will never own that.
5. You must say this sentence to everyone you meet today: “HILLARY CLINTON WON THE POPULAR VOTE!” The MAJORITY of our fellow Americans preferred Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Period. Fact. If you woke up this morning thinking you live in an effed-up country, you don’t. The majority of your fellow Americans wanted Hillary, not Trump. The only reason he’s president is because of an arcane, insane 18th-century idea called the Electoral College. Until we change that, we’ll continue to have presidents we didn’t elect and didn’t want. You live in a country where a majority of its citizens have said they believe there’s climate change, they believe women should be paid the same as men, they want a debt-free college education, they don’t want us invading countries, they want a raise in the minimum wage and they want a single-payer true universal health care system. None of that has changed. We live in a country where the majority agree with the “liberal” position. We just lack the liberal leadership to make that happen (see: #1 above). Let's try to get this all done by noon today. -- Michael Moore

Republican Donald Trump became the US president-elect early Wednesday morning, a   result that surprised many as most polls had given Democrat Hillary Clinton a greater   chance of winning even as the race tightened.
Now that a Trump presidency is imminent, however, people on   Twitter — especially Muslim-Americans and Latinos — are reporting   hate speech and hate crimes they're attributing to Trump   supporters.
Shaun King , a   reporter for the New York Daily News, on Wednesday began writing   on Twitter about instances of hate speech people said they had   experienced. You can see a few recent ones below.

Insanul Ahmed, a senior editor at the music website Genius, made   another list, a Twitter Moments compilation , called ""Day 1 in Trump's   America."" On Wednesday, the list updated every few minutes with   new tweets describing what Ahmed described as ""racist episodes   POC are facing now that Trump is our President Elect.""

A Medium post compiling similar reports, also called ""Day 1   in Trump's America,"" was published Wednesday by Verge reporter   and photographer Sean O'Kane.
The post's leading photo shows graffiti on a softball dugout wall   that says ""Make America White Again"" and is next to a swastika.   The photo was taken Wednesday by Brian Quinn, a journalist from the   Wellsville Daily Reporter in Wellsville, New York.

O'Kane linked to a story from The Syracuse Post-Standard, which reported that vandals burned rainbow flags (a symbol of the   LGBT-rights movement) hanging from homes in western New York.
News outlets including Quartz and The Washington Post have started to report on similar issues   as well, and the Southern   Poverty Law Center is asking for people to send reports their   way.",0

WASHINGTON D.C. — President-elect Donald Trump and his wife Melania Trump met with President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama here at the White House on Thursday, as the president continued his stated committment to a smooth transition of power.
But behind the scenes, the White House took a less friendly approach.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the Obamas had canceled a photo op with the Trumps, something that Bush had done with the Obamas in 2008.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest refused to explain the details of the decision but denied the story.
“Not true,” he said, during the White House press conference, when asked about the report. He also denied that the lack of a photo opportunity had anything to do with First Lady Michelle Obama not wanting to be photographed with the Trump family. He argued that it was not a “snub” of the Trumps, but rather a different strategy of press access.
The press pool was allowed into the Oval Office on Thursday, to photograph Trump and Obama together after their 90-minute meeting. The two men met alone, with no staffers present.
But Obama snubbed the press by telling Trump not to answer any of their questions after the meeting.
“Here’s a good rule. Don’t answer any questions,” Obama said to Trump after reporters shouted questions at the pair.
Despite the pleasantries exchanged between the two political foes, Earnest specified afterwards that Obama still believed that Trump was unsuitable to be president.
“Look, the president’s views haven’t changed, he stands by what he said on the campaign trail,” Earnest said in response to a question during the White House press briefing.
Earnest’s remarks contrasted with Obama’s welcome of Trump at the White House, promising to meet the standards set by President George W. Bush.
He revealed that the first lady hosted Melania Trump for some tea, and they toured the White House together and even walked on the Truman balcony. The pair also discussed raising children at the White House, as Baron Trump will live there with his parents.
Earnest said that Michelle Obama understood the anxieties of “living inside a museum” like the White House and noted that it could be a “difficult transition” for families.
White House communications director Jen Psaki and Deputy Communications Director Liz Allen met with Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks, according to Earnest, who also visited with her.
Earnest hinted that the White House might release a photo of the two couples meeting.
“We can go back to the White House photographer and see if there are any photos from the greet, so that you all can get some insight into how that went,” he said.

Donald Trump won a Republican White House, Senate and House because he led a rebellion against the Democrats’ embrace of Silicon Valley’s business model, which profits from global trade, offshore labor and foreign skilled workers.
Despite all the hoopla about supposedly booming American high-tech jobs, globalization and the rise of China since the early 1990s have the cost the United States about 5.8 million in U.S. manufacturing jobs, about one third of the sector’s total workforce.

A huge portion of the jobs loss is due to giant Silicon Valley technology corporations’ offshoring of the vast majority of their business operations. As a result, the U.S. annual balance for advanced technology products sales has fallen from a $35 billion surplus in 1992 to a $92 billion deficit at the end in 2015.
As major government contractors, Silicon Valley corporations for decades maintained a neutral stance on political lobbying and campaign contributions. But TechCrunch blog nicknamed Silicon Valley the “ Valley of the Democrats ,” after PayPal co-Founder and top venture capitalist Peter Thiel reported in an interview last year that over 83 percent of political contributions by the area’s tech executives went solely to Democrats.
The bipartisan  Center for Responsive Politics  that tracks the influence of Silicon Valley money on American elections and government bureaucrats commented, “Just as water flows downhill, money in politics flows to where the power is.”  Their research found that with the rise of Democrat Barack Obama since 2008, Silicon Valley’s annual lobbying expenditures skyrocketed by 800 percent , from $17.8 million to $139.5 million.
Silicon Valley’s “leaning liberal” image has mirrored its effort to maximize profits by importing foreign engineers and software coders under the U.S. Labor Department’s H-1B visa program for foreigners with “ distinguished merit and ability . The program was designed to recruit people like Nobel Prize winners, but Silicon Valley has been interested in cheap labor.
Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and venture capitalist Ron Conway founded FWD.US in 2013. The organization has lobbied for immigration reform to expand H-1B visas.
Breitbart News has written numerous articles on how Hewlett-Packard, Southern California Edison, University of California and dozens of Silicon Valley tech firms have replaced American high-tech workers with H-1B foreigners .
As the ultimate slap in the face, fired U.S. workers are usually hired as temps to train their Indian and Chinese replacements, who do the same job for two-thirds less pay.
Just before the election, Peter Thiel said, “Silicon Valley has been incredibly successful over the last decade.” But for America, “I think the truth has been more one of specific success, but more general failure.” He said rich and powerful tech leaders had not focused improving the national welfare outside of Silicon Valley.
Day two of the “ Trump Bounce ” sent the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Index up almost 1.5 percent to an all-time-high, led by U.S. banks and industrial stocks. But the big losers on this historic day were Silicon Valley stocks, which were down by 1.5 percent .
