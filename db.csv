For all you political junkies out there, you’re probably aware that there was a presidential election last night. The Republican candidate – Donald Trump – emerged the winner, but some people (like millions of them) are kind of terrified by this result.
Perhaps that explains why filmmaker Michael Moore’s Facebook post today is currently going crazy viral. His “Morning After To-Do List” is a challenge to citizens to reject fear and embrace the power we all have to get out there and actually do something that matters. 
You can read the transcript of his post below or view it directly here :  
Morning After To-Do List:
1. Take over the Democratic Party and return it to the people. They have failed us miserably.
2. Fire all pundits, predictors, pollsters and anyone else in the media who had a narrative they wouldn't let go of and refused to listen to or acknowledge what was really going on. Those same bloviators will now tell us we must ""heal the divide"" and “come together.” They will pull more hooey like that out of their ass in the days to come. Turn them off.
3. Any Democratic member of Congress who didn’t wake up this morning ready to fight, resist and obstruct in the way Republicans did against President Obama every day for eight full years must step out of the way and let those of us who know the score lead the way in stopping the meanness and the madness that's about to begin.
4. Everyone must stop saying they are “stunned” and “shocked.” What you mean to say is that you were in a bubble and weren’t paying attention to your fellow Americans and their despair. YEARS of being neglected by both parties, the anger and the need for revenge against the system only grew. Along came a TV star they liked whose plan was to destroy both parties and tell them all “You're fired!” Trump’s victory is no surprise. He was never a joke. Treating him as one only strengthened him. He is both a creature and a creation of the media and the media will never own that.
5. You must say this sentence to everyone you meet today: “HILLARY CLINTON WON THE POPULAR VOTE!” The MAJORITY of our fellow Americans preferred Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Period. Fact. If you woke up this morning thinking you live in an effed-up country, you don’t. The majority of your fellow Americans wanted Hillary, not Trump. The only reason he’s president is because of an arcane, insane 18th-century idea called the Electoral College. Until we change that, we’ll continue to have presidents we didn’t elect and didn’t want. You live in a country where a majority of its citizens have said they believe there’s climate change, they believe women should be paid the same as men, they want a debt-free college education, they don’t want us invading countries, they want a raise in the minimum wage and they want a single-payer true universal health care system. None of that has changed. We live in a country where the majority agree with the “liberal” position. We just lack the liberal leadership to make that happen (see: #1 above). Let's try to get this all done by noon today. -- Michael Moore

Republican Donald Trump became the US president-elect early Wednesday morning, a   result that surprised many as most polls had given Democrat Hillary Clinton a greater   chance of winning even as the race tightened.
Now that a Trump presidency is imminent, however, people on   Twitter — especially Muslim-Americans and Latinos — are reporting   hate speech and hate crimes they're attributing to Trump   supporters.
Shaun King , a   reporter for the New York Daily News, on Wednesday began writing   on Twitter about instances of hate speech people said they had   experienced. You can see a few recent ones below.

WASHINGTON D.C. — President-elect Donald Trump and his wife Melania Trump met with President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama here at the White House on Thursday, as the president continued his stated committment to a smooth transition of power.
But behind the scenes, the White House took a less friendly approach.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the Obamas had canceled a photo op with the Trumps, something that Bush had done with the Obamas in 2008.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest refused to explain the details of the decision but denied the story.
“Not true,” he said, during the White House press conference, when asked about the report. He also denied that the lack of a photo opportunity had anything to do with First Lady Michelle Obama not wanting to be photographed with the Trump family. He argued that it was not a “snub” of the Trumps, but rather a different strategy of press access.
The press pool was allowed into the Oval Office on Thursday, to photograph Trump and Obama together after their 90-minute meeting. The two men met alone, with no staffers present.
But Obama snubbed the press by telling Trump not to answer any of their questions after the meeting.
“Here’s a good rule. Don’t answer any questions,” Obama said to Trump after reporters shouted questions at the pair.
Despite the pleasantries exchanged between the two political foes, Earnest specified afterwards that Obama still believed that Trump was unsuitable to be president.
“Look, the president’s views haven’t changed, he stands by what he said on the campaign trail,” Earnest said in response to a question during the White House press briefing.
Earnest’s remarks contrasted with Obama’s welcome of Trump at the White House, promising to meet the standards set by President George W. Bush.
He revealed that the first lady hosted Melania Trump for some tea, and they toured the White House together and even walked on the Truman balcony. The pair also discussed raising children at the White House, as Baron Trump will live there with his parents.
Earnest said that Michelle Obama understood the anxieties of “living inside a museum” like the White House and noted that it could be a “difficult transition” for families.
White House communications director Jen Psaki and Deputy Communications Director Liz Allen met with Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks, according to Earnest, who also visited with her.
Earnest hinted that the White House might release a photo of the two couples meeting.
“We can go back to the White House photographer and see if there are any photos from the greet, so that you all can get some insight into how that went,” he said.

Donald Trump won a Republican White House, Senate and House because he led a rebellion against the Democrats’ embrace of Silicon Valley’s business model, which profits from global trade, offshore labor and foreign skilled workers.
Despite all the hoopla about supposedly booming American high-tech jobs, globalization and the rise of China since the early 1990s have the cost the United States about 5.8 million in U.S. manufacturing jobs, about one third of the sector’s total workforce.

A huge portion of the jobs loss is due to giant Silicon Valley technology corporations’ offshoring of the vast majority of their business operations. As a result, the U.S. annual balance for advanced technology products sales has fallen from a $35 billion surplus in 1992 to a $92 billion deficit at the end in 2015.
As major government contractors, Silicon Valley corporations for decades maintained a neutral stance on political lobbying and campaign contributions. But TechCrunch blog nicknamed Silicon Valley the “ Valley of the Democrats ,” after PayPal co-Founder and top venture capitalist Peter Thiel reported in an interview last year that over 83 percent of political contributions by the area’s tech executives went solely to Democrats.
The bipartisan  Center for Responsive Politics  that tracks the influence of Silicon Valley money on American elections and government bureaucrats commented, “Just as water flows downhill, money in politics flows to where the power is.”  Their research found that with the rise of Democrat Barack Obama since 2008, Silicon Valley’s annual lobbying expenditures skyrocketed by 800 percent , from $17.8 million to $139.5 million.
Silicon Valley’s “leaning liberal” image has mirrored its effort to maximize profits by importing foreign engineers and software coders under the U.S. Labor Department’s H-1B visa program for foreigners with “ distinguished merit and ability . The program was designed to recruit people like Nobel Prize winners, but Silicon Valley has been interested in cheap labor.
Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and venture capitalist Ron Conway founded FWD.US in 2013. The organization has lobbied for immigration reform to expand H-1B visas.
Breitbart News has written numerous articles on how Hewlett-Packard, Southern California Edison, University of California and dozens of Silicon Valley tech firms have replaced American high-tech workers with H-1B foreigners .
As the ultimate slap in the face, fired U.S. workers are usually hired as temps to train their Indian and Chinese replacements, who do the same job for two-thirds less pay.
Just before the election, Peter Thiel said, “Silicon Valley has been incredibly successful over the last decade.” But for America, “I think the truth has been more one of specific success, but more general failure.” He said rich and powerful tech leaders had not focused improving the national welfare outside of Silicon Valley.
Day two of the “ Trump Bounce ” sent the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Index up almost 1.5 percent to an all-time-high, led by U.S. banks and industrial stocks. But the big losers on this historic day were Silicon Valley stocks, which were down by 1.5 percent .

Michael Wolff writes in The Hollywood Reporter on the abject failure of the corporate media establishment in covering the 2016 election.
From The Hollywood Reporter :
SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER
The media turned itself into the opposition and, accordingly, was voted down as the new political reality emerged: Ads don’t work, polls don’t work, celebrities don’t work, media endorsements don’t work, ground games don’t work.
Not only did the media get almost everything about this presidential election wrong, but it became the central issue, or the stand-in for all those issues, that the great new American Trump Party voted against.
The transmutation of political identities has arguably devolved into two parties: the Trump one, the angry retro people, and the Media Party, representing the smug modern people, each anathema to and uncomprehending of the other. Certainly, there was no moment in the campaign where the Media Party did not see itself as a virtuous and, most often, determinative factor in the race. Given this, the chants of “CNN sucks” at Trump rallies should not have been entirely surprising.
But they were. The media took this as a comment about press freedom rather than its own failure to read the zeitgeist. In fact, it largely failed to tell any story other than its own.
…
It all washed away. Beyonce. The tax returns. The theoretical blue wall. Trump as sexual predator. Putin. His shambolic debate performances. Hispanics. Indeed, every aspect of the media narrative, dust. This narrative not only did not diminish him, it fortified him. The criticism of Trump defined the people who were criticizing him, reliably giving the counter-puncher something to punch. It was a juicy target. The Media Party not only fashioned the takedown narrative and demanded a special sort of allegiance to it — Twitter serving as the orthodoxy echo chamber — but, suspending most ordinary conflict rules, according to the Center for Public Integrity, gave lots of cash to Hillary. The media turned itself into the opposition and, accordingly, was voted down.
…
There may be few instances, except perhaps under authoritarian regimes, where the media has so successfully propounded a view of events not only of its own making but at such odds with reality.

“Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive/ But to be young was very heaven!” So wrote the poet William Wordsworth in 1792.  In my case, I’m feeling blissful, but, alas, not so young.  So I’m one for two.
Back in the late 18th century, Wordsworth was writing about the French Revolution (about which he was soon disillusioned).  In my case, here in the early 21st century, I’m thinking strictly positive thoughts about this latest peaceful American revolution, which begs comparison to two other political earthquakes: the Reagan Revolution of 1980, and the Gingrich Revolution of 1994.
SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER
And now to the Trump Revolution of 2016.  Here are ten takeaway points:
1) It’s 1828 all over again.  Although 1980 and 1994 offer some parallels, perhaps the best 2016 comparison is to an election from nearly two centuries ago: the 1828 contest.  Back then, challenger Andrew Jackson mobilized a heretofore invisible coalition—that is, voters from such frontier states as Illinois and Missouri—against the incumbent president, John Quincy Adams.  Jackson’s peaceful populist rebellion, remembered as the “revolt of the rustics,” swept the Tennessean into the White House.
Without a doubt, that presidential campaign was bitter: It’s fair to say that the Eastern elites of that era were as horrified by Jackson as the Eastern elites of our time have been horrified by Donald Trump.  For example, in the so-called “ coffin handbills ” that circulated widely in that campaign, Jackson was accused of everything from adultery to mass murder to cannibalism.
Yet despite all that establishment vitriol, Jackson won, and thus launched a new political realignment.  And at the core of the new Jacksonian coalition was the alliance Southern white Protestants and Northern Catholics.  Those two groups didn’t have much in common, except for a shared antipathy to Adams’ political party, dominated by Yankee Protestants, who were the common foe of both Southerners and Catholics.
Indeed, that “anti” spirit was enough to bind the Jacksonian factions together.  Thus in 1828, Jackson, Southerner that he was, carried not only South Carolina, but also Pennsylvania. That North-South coalition remained dominant in American politics for most of the next century-and-a-half, surviving even the Civil War.
And yet along the way, the parties flipped, so that by the late 20th century, the Jacksonian Democrats had become Nixon-Reagan Republicans.  More recently, in the last quarter-century, this long-standing coalition, at least at the national level, has become partially undone.  That is, the South has been voting Republican for president, and the North has been voting Democratic.
Now, in 2016, Trump has begun the process of gluing the North-South coalition back together: On Tuesday, like Jackson long ago, Trump carried both South Carolina and Pennsylvania—and the Keystone State had not gone Republican since 1988.  As Fred Barnes of The Weekly Standard headlined his post-election piece, “ Trump Didn’t Split the GOP–He Strengthened It .”
2) Americans don’t like dynasties. Speaking of that 1828 election, one lesson is that Americans, instinctive small “r” republicans that they are, don’t like dynasties, as they smack too much of royalty.  The same John Quincy Adams, our sixth president, was the son of the second president, John Adams.  And yet the younger Adams’ defeat in 1828 spelled the end of the family’s success in presidential politics.
Moreover, we can see that in a democracy, dynasties are almost impossible to maintain, because political talent is not often heritable, nor is it transferrable—as Hillary Clinton has just reminded us.  And nobody sees an electoral future for Chelsea Clinton.
So we can see now, in 2016: When Americans were confronted with two dynastic candidates, Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, both were rejected.  Indeed, had it not been for the extensive collusion of the supposedly neutral Democratic National Committee with her campaign, Clinton might well have been derailed in the Democratic primaries, just as Jeb was in the GOP primaries.  (So we can see: Trump can be credited with putting the kibosh on two dynasties.)
Finally, we can add that Clinton always faced an uphill climb, because  history shows that it’s hard for the party in the White House to win a third consecutive term; in fact, it’s happened only once since 1952, and that was back in 1988.
3)  Brexit comes to America.  If references to 1828 seem too obscure, this election can also usefully be compared to the June “Brexit” in the United Kingdom.  As Breitbart readers know, Brexit was the vote that emancipated Britain from the clutches of the European Union.  In fact, Trump was quick to associate himself with that populist-nationalist spirit; as he said in the UK right after the vote, he would be “Mr. Brexit” for America.  And with a key assist from Nigel Farage, the hero of Brexit, Trump made it happen.
Even now, at this early stage, we can itemize some of the bureaucratic Babels that the US will soon be freed from thanks to Trump’s victory, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Obama administration’s “climate change” agreement, which is currently on track to de-carbonize—read: completely de-industrialize—America in the next few decades.  Such are the benefits of sovereign independence.
4) Most polls aren’t worth much.  As with Brexit, virtually all of the polls about America’s presidential election were wrong.  Indeed, even into the last hours, pollsters were arguing about the precise certainty of, and dimensions of, the looming Clinton victory.  Just last week, Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight.com was being attacked by Ryan Grim of The Huffington Post because Silver insisted that Trump had a 35 percent chance of winning, while Grim declared flatly that Trump had no more than a two percent chance.  The New York Times, meanwhile, although not as partisanly optimistic as The Huffington Post, averred that Trump had just a 15 percent chance of winning.
Still, we can recall a short—very short—honor roll of accurate polls.  The two that leap to mind are  Investor’s Business Daily/TIPP   and  USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times .  As the LA Times’ David Lauter observed of his newspaper’s surveys:
The poll’s findings caused dismay—even outrage—among some readers, especially Democrats, who have denounced it and often criticized the Times for running it.
Of course, there’s little reason to think that the MSM will embrace the success of those accurate polls.  Why?  Because they might show Republicans doing well, and, as we have learned, the standard MSM schtick is to proclaim, at all times, “REPUBLICANS DOOMED!” in the hope that Republican voters will lose heart.  In fact, Trump’s victory notwithstanding, the mood of the MSM seems to be as hostile as ever, as evidenced by The New York Times’ editorial after the election;  here’s a sample of the Times’ latest rant:
Mr. Trump is the most unprepared president-elect in modern history.  We know that by words and actions, he has shown himself to be temperamentally unfit to lead a diverse nation of 320 million people.  We know he has threatened to prosecute and jail his political opponents, and he has said he would curtail the freedom of the press.  We know he lies without compunction.
If that’s the tone the Times takes, then a polling outfit that shows Republicans doing poorly will always be more welcome at Times HQ than one that might show Republicans doing well.
5) Middle America has asserted itself, and these folks have their own ideas.  Throughout the ’16 election, the MSM and the rest of the chattering class viewed the American working- and middle class with a combination of contempt and pity.  To illustrate, we can look back to July 13, when The New York Times headlined a news story, “ For Whites Sensing Decline, Donald Trump Unleashes Words of Resistance .”   We might pause to ask: Would the Times use the word “decline” in regard to any group, other than whites?  Indeed, as well we all know, the MSM has been joined in its anti-white mockery by big chunks of what’s billed, these days, as “comedy .”
This liberal groupthink has been pervasive; it has settled like a thick fog on the worldviews of the chatterers in Washington, DC, New York City, and Los Angeles.  And while this hive-mindedness makes life comfortable for urban snobs, it also blinded them to larger realities, including the reality of their own declining influence.
A few MSMers noticed this loss of mojo: One such is Politico’s Jack Shafer , who wrote recently that media bias, as highlighted by Trump, had cost the MSM its power to affect the thinking of half the country:
As a result of Trump’s attack-the-messenger strategy, for perhaps the first time in U.S. history no mainstream outlet has any influence over the voters backing one of the presidential nominees.  This neutering of mainstream media by Trump has made it more difficult for the press to frame the issues effectively.
In fact, it’s even arguable that such scorn plays to the advantage of Republicans; that is, the MSM hostility is so heavy-handed that it has boomeranged .
Hence Trump’s victory, in which Republican voters were guided by everything but what they were being told by the likes of Clinton staffer-turned-Clinton donor George Stephanopoulos .  Thus Wednesday’s rueful headline in The New York Times: “ Donald Trump is Elected President in Stunning Repudiation of the Establishment .”
Meanwhile, the elite have finally discovered, to their dismay, that all those “ bitter clingers ” and “ deplorables ” have minds of their own.  As journalist Ron Brownstein noted, Trump won working-class white voters by a wider margin than did Ronald Reagan.  And those folks in the middle have distinct opinions on such issues as immigration, law and order, and trade that are much different from those of their self-appointed bi-coastal betters.
Moreover, we can observe that while this smug culture of incomprehension and condescension has been a characteristic of the left, it can also be observed, in milder form, on the right.  That is, many Republicans, perhaps even today, just can’t quite believe that Trump stands for anything more than reality-TV showmanship.  Yet as anyone who reads Breitbart, for example, knows, serious thinking has been going on about what a populist-nationalist center-right coalition might look like, even if the familiar DC think-tanks haven’t been interested.
Still, the new voices are loud and insistent.  One such belongs to Stephen K. Bannon, who stepped away from leading this site to serve as CEO of the Trump campaign.  Bannon put it bluntly to Breitbart editor-in-chief Alex Marlow on Wednesday morning’s broadcast of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM: “Last night . . . you saw the hobbits finally had a chance to speak.” The phrase “hobbits,” of course, is an ironic reference to one of the many dismissive epithets hurled at grassroots activists in the past few years.
And now that half the country has found its voice, it’ll be darn hard for the Establishment to shut them up—although, of course, they’ll certainly try.
6) Wall Street took it on the chin.  As documented by many—the latest being Rana Foroohar in her new book, Makers and Takers: The Rise of Finance and the Fall of American Business –one of the big economic stories of the last few decades has been the rise of financialism.  That is, the rise of the spreadsheet economy and the decline of traditional inventing and manufacturing.  Foroohar notes, for example, that only 15 percent of the money “invested” by financial institutions goes into actual business investment; the other 85 percent is spent buying and selling existing financial instruments.  In other words, it’s casino capitalism, and nothing more; that might be a formula for profits in Manhattan, but it’s not a formula for jobs and livelihoods across the country.
To be sure, Wall Street has been perfectly happy playing this new game: After all, to them, money is money; indeed, it’s probably easier to make more by simply manipulating algorithms than by actually making things.  In fact, finance is so profitable—in some years, it has accounted for almost half the profits earned in the US—that the “Masters of the Universe” have barely noticed that public support for their activities has hemorrhaged away.  Hence headlines such as this, from Reuters: “ Wall Street elite stunned at Trump triumph .”  It’s a safe bet that Wall Streeters will be paying close attention from now on—although whether or not they change their ways remains to be seen.  Now, the answer to that question must come from President Trump.
In the meantime, it’s more important for Republicans to be pro-Main Street than anti-Wall Street.  Nobody needs socialism; what’s needed is more capitalism—specifically, more capital, along with a better business environment, for Flyover Country, so that new small businesses can sprout up somewhere other than Silicon Valley.
7) President Obama also took it on the chin—or maybe the gut.  Here’s the headline in Politico on Wednesday morning: “ Obama reeling from gut punch of Trump win/ America’s decision to embrace Trump and reject Obama’s third term shocked the White House .”  We can pause over that strong language, “gut punch.” Once again, this was in Politico, a member in good standing of the MSM.  In the words of reporter Edward-Isaac Dovere:
Obama said for months on the campaign trail that he’d consider Donald Trump’s election a personal repudiation.  And it was.  The Senate and House results leave no question, as if there could be one.
Then the Politico man added these words, sure to be painful to any progressive, about the prospects for the Obama administration’s ideology in its waning days:
They’ve already lost the chance to lock in Obama’s vision of America, one that is educated and pragmatist, multicultural, cosmopolitan and globalist.
Yes, that was, and is, the Obama administration: “multicultural, cosmopolitan and globalist.” That’s exactly what was rejected on Tuesday.
8) The Republican Establishment now faces a challenge.  As everyone knows, the Republican Establishment was slow to embrace Trump—except when it was downright hostile.
So now we can see: There are two Republican parties: First, the Trump Insurgents, and, second, the Establishment.
For years, the bulk of the GOP Establishment has supported policies such as open borders and free trade.  That is, policies that were never popular with workers, including Hispanic workers , and now have been resoundingly rejected by Trump and his supporters.  And soon Trump will be the 45th President.
So what will happen?  Can the GOP find a way to embrace the Insurgents and thus unite them with the Establishment?  If so, that would make the GOP a formidable force.   And as we have seen, there’s ample precedent for such strange-bedfellow alliances; the aforementioned Jacksonian coalition—Southern white Protestants and Northern Catholics—was bitterly divided over such issues as Prohibition, and yet since they were even more bitterly opposed to the Yankees, they stuck together.
So by that same reckoning, it’s possible to imagine that Republicans will find common ground.  They can start, for example, with such issues as Life and the Second Amendment—and seal the deal with a conservative Supreme Court nominee to replace the late Antonin Scalia—although those unifying issues are no longer sufficient.  Indeed, even tax cuts, popular and necessary as they might be, are also probably not sufficient.
Edward Conard, a prominent Mitt Romney supporter four years ago, has waded deeply into this coalitional pool. In his new book, The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class , he argues that if the investor class wants to keep its treasured low marginal tax rates, it must give substantial ground in other areas of importance to the middle class, notably, immigration and trade.  In other words, in Conard’s view,  the focus must be on productive capitalism for America, not redistributive globalism for the world.
9)  Evan McMullin will have to find a new career plan.  McMullin, the former Congressional staffer-turned-independent presidential candidate, was widely regarded as nothing more than a plutocratic cat’s paw—that is, as a political tool to be wielded by rich Never Trump Republicans.
Indeed, McMullin, at least at first, seemed to find a niche among pro-Bush 43 Republicans.  As Jim Antle wrote earlier this month in The American Conservative, “McMullin supporters were generally happy with George W. Bush.” One is perfectly entitled to take that position, although not many do.  Antle added of McMullin:
Many of his high-profile supporters wanted the Republican Party to nominate Marco Rubio, the candidate most closely associated with the 43rd president’s legacy on immigration and foreign policy.
In other words, McMullin was the candidate of the pre-Trump Old Guard.  For his part, Trump referred to McMullin as a “ puppet .”
In fact, the Utah-born McMullin seemed to have only one goal this year: to deprive Trump of the Beehive State’s six electoral votes, either by winning the state outright or by throwing the election to Hillary Clinton.  Either way, McMullin failed; he won just 20 percent of the Utah vote, finishing behind Clinton.  Meanwhile, Trump won the state with 46 percent.
And yet here’s something interesting about McMullin.  In the course of his campaign, he seemed to drift away from Trump-bashing and toward something with more of a future: liberating Western land from federal control .  As an astute observer has noted, federal lands contain hundreds of trillions —yes, that’s trillions with a “t”—of dollars worth of oil, gas, and other natural resources.  And yet all that wealth hs been locked up by Uncle Sam in the name of “environmentalism.” Needless to say, the green left, never itself hurting for money, has been delighted by this lockdown.  And yet strangely, most Republicans have been quiescent about this national impoverishment.
In the meantime, the feds have been ratcheing up the pressure on Western landowners and leaseholders , in what’s clearly an accelerating effort to push Westerners off the land –all for the sake of owls, wind farms, and any other whim that floats a fancy in Manhattan or Malibu.
So now, with the election behind him, and his Trump-destroying mission a failure, we’ll have to see what path McMullin chooses.  Will he go to work for some big hedge fund?  Or will he stay in Utah and continue to champion the political rights, and economic future, of the West?
If McMullin chooses the latter course, he might end up making a substantial contribution—a contribution, that is, not only to the pro-Trump Deplorables, but also to other Deplorables, notably working-class Hispanics and other minorities.  These ethnic groups, who seem to have mostly stuck with Clinton in this election, will soon enough figure out that the Green Democrats have no plan for getting them good jobs at good wages.  And why not?  Because good jobs at good wages typically consist of making things, or growing things, or mining things; that is, all the things that the Greens despise.  And out of that class conflict—trust-funded aristocrats and other varieties of NIMBY vs. people who need to work—comes a huge political opportunity for Republicans.  And if McMullin wants to help by reminding working Westerners that their future depends on pro-growth policies, more power to him.  So far, at least that’s an “if.”
10) For all the talk about a Republican “civil war,” the bigger intra-party fight is likely to be among Democrats.  As we have seen, Republicans face their own coalitional challenges.  And yet the Republicans won; it’s easier for victors to solve their problems, because success puts everyone in a good mood.  By contrast, losers, not surprisingly, tend to embittered and vengeful.
And so, as the Democrats look to future elections, the intra-party wrangling must commence.
In fact, it has already commenced: In her surprisingly classy concession speech on Wednesday, Clinton hit many familiar Democratic themes, but notably omitted any mention of the Democrats’ more extreme positions, such as support for open borders, support for “retraining” the police, and praise for the Black Lives Matter group.  So how will those omissions  sit with Democrats who hold the opposite position?  Stay tuned!
In the meantime, a Politico headline on Wednesday spoke volumes: “ Democratic Party in crisis .” Reporter Gabriel DeBenedetti asked: Is it the Clintons’ party?  Or is it Obama’s?  Or Elizabeth Warren’s?  The reporter continued:
Those questions are just the beginning. Is Obama’s coalition of millennials, minorities, and women not enough, party operatives are now asking.  . . . Are working class white men out of the party’s grasp forever?  Good questions, all.  Can the Democrats flourish without their historic base among the working class?
Indeed, there does appear to be some genuine soul searching on the Democratic side: “I had no idea how deep the divisions are, how real the pain is,” Democratic strategist Paul Begala said on CNN . “Donald Trump has given voice to some real spectacular pain on his side.”
Where that soul-searching process will lead remains to be seen, and yet on Wednesday evening, a possible answer came poking through, as  Bernie Sanders weighed in with a new threat to the Democrats’ stability .  Taking dead aim at the elitist, globalist, billionaire-ish, orientation of Obama-Clintonism, Sanders declared:
Donald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media.  People are tired of working longer hours for lower wages, of seeing decent paying jobs go to China and other low-wage countries, of billionaires not paying any federal income taxes and of not being able to afford a college education for their kids—all while the very rich become much richer.
And then Sanders added this kicker of a warning to Democrats:
To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him.
To be sure, Sanders’ statement was hardly a love letter to Trump; in the very next sentence, Sanders pledged to oppose Trump to the extent that the Vermonter judges him to be “racist, sexist, xenophobic,” etc.  And since we know that the Democrats have a hair-trigger when it comes to any violation of  PC orthodoxy, we can see that Sanders has given himself an easy out—if he wants it.
Yet still, Sanders has put the Democrats Part on notice: The populist wing of the party is in a state of turmoil, as rank-and-file Democrats come to realize that the Corporatist-Multiculturalist-Green elite that has led the party for decades can’t deliver the goods for ordinary working people.
Thus the larger meaning of Sanders’ statement is clear: If Trump can redeem his pledge to help the Forgotten Man and the Forgotten Woman, he and the Republicans will benefit, too, as the last working people in the Democratic Party turn out the lights on their ancestral political home.    And the Democrats know that they can’t win with just street activists, enviros, and self-appointed “social justice warriors.”
Whew!  That’s been a lot of ground to cover, but then, if time permitted, one could delineate 100 takeaways, not just 10.  And over time, time will permit.

Men!
WASHINGTON ― Now that the election is over, the D.C. ritual of jockeying for top positions in the next administration has begun. Insiders give the press names of candidates who are real possibilities; long shots, just to see what reaction they get; friends and, sometimes, even themselves. 
So far, the names being floated for a Donald Trump administration largely have one thing in common: They’re men. And for the most part, they’re white men. BuzzFeed obtained one  list of 41 names under consideration for Cabinet and top White House positions. Of those, only six are women. In other news stories listing potential appointees, no women are named. 
Many of them are also fringe figures ― people who have never been in government or who have been out of government for some time and are itching to get back in.
Trump did not have the support of much of the Republican establishment, and many of the officials who would traditionally get into an administration now may be hesitant to do so for a leader they distrust. Trump may also block them since they didn’t support him. Meanwhile, some figures who have been lurking on the fringe may now have found a home with this unlikely president-elect. 
Here are the people being discussed so far for some top positions: 
Transition Chair: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) is currently leading Trump’s transition efforts, but if he no longer can ― he’s been tainted, for example, by the Bridgegate scandal ― tech billionaire Peter Thiel could replace him. Thiel secretly funded Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit that took down Gawker.com and once wrote that women getting the vote was bad for democracy .
White House Chief of Staff: Two top candidates for this leading role are believed to be Reince Priebus , the Republican National Committee chairman, and Corey Lewandowski , Trump’s first campaign manager who is currently a paid commentator for CNN. Steve Bannon, the chairman of the conservative  Breitbart News who took a leave to be Trump’s campaign CEO, is another contender. Bannon’s website has peddled some of the major alt-right conspiracy theories and spread the vitriolic rhetoric that fueled Trump’s rise.
Attorney General: Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) is frequently talked about as a contender. Giuliani told CNN Thursday he would consider the job “if it really was just me and I couldn’t point to three others that would be just as good or better.” New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) has also been talked about as a front-runner, as have Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R). During the campaign, questions were raised about whether Trump improperly made campaign contributions to Bondi’s re-election effort to influence whether she investigated allegations against Trump University.
The attorney general oversees the Justice Department and enforces areas like civil rights. Giuliani has boasted that he  made New York “safe” by implementing “ stop and frisk ,” a policing method that disproportionately affects black people and Latinos. He has also said “ anything’s legal ” during war. Two of Christie’s former top aides were recently convicted of conspiracy and fraud in the Bridgegate scandal, and their testimony has implicated the governor in their schemes. 
Secretary of State: Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), former U.N. Ambassador  John Bolton and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) are reportedly under consideration for this top job. 
Defense Secretary: Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), one of Trump’s earliest supporters, has been mentioned as a possible defense secretary, as has retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn , who has also been floated as national security adviser. Other names are Stephen Hadley, who served as a top national security official to President George W. Bush; Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr. (R-Calif.) and former Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.). 
Homeland Security Secretary: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) and Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke are on the list for this position. Clarke, who is African-American, has been a forceful critic of the Black Lives Matter movement and spoke at the Republican National Convention. He also called for Trump supporters to bring out “ pitchforks and torches ” to fight a rigged system. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) is also a possible pick. The department includes the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that the senator argues should ramp up its deportations.
Interior Secretary: Forrest Lucas , a California oil executive, is considered a top contender. Venture capitalist Robert Grady and fracking mogul Harold Hamm are also being discussed, as are three women : Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R), Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (R) and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R).
Treasury Secretary:  Steven Mnuchin , the former Goldman Sachs executive who was finance chair of Trump’s campaign, is reportedly on the short list. Trump received a significant amount of criticism when he unveiled his 13-member economic advisory team in August. There were six men named Steve on the list ― including Mnuchin ― but not a single woman. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon is also under consideration, although he has said he would not be interested in the role. Other names are Wall Street veteran Carl Icahn and Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), who is chair of the House Financial Services Committee.
Education Secretary: Neurosurgeon and former GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson is being discussed for this post, as is Hoover Institution fellow Williamson Evers, who also worked in the Education Department during George W. Bush’s administration. 
Commerce Secretary: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) and former Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.) make this list as well, as do former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R), former Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) and Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.). In the business world, financier Lew Eisenberg ― who also chaired a joint fundraising committee for Trump and the Republican National Committee ― is being discussed, along with the former CEO of steelmaker Nucor Dan DiMicco and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross . 
Health and Human Services Secretary: Florida Gov. Rick Scott  (R), retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and former New Jersey state Sen. Rich Bagger (R) are the names at the top of the list. 
Agriculture Secretary: One of the names on this list is Texas Agricultural Commissioner Sid Miller, who called  Hillary Clinton a “cunt” on Twitter . Other names  include Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback (R), Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman (R), former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (R), former Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R), National Council of Farmer Cooperatives CEO Chuck Conner, agribusiness leader Charles Herbster , Indiana dairy executive Mike McCloskey, Iowa agribusiness mogul Bruce Rastetter and Indiana farmer and congressional candidate Kip Tom. 
Energy Secretary: Fracking mogul Harold Hamm and venture capitalist Robert Grady are the two names most frequently mentioned.
Labor Secretary:  Victoria Lipnic , commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission since 2010, is frequently mentioned for this position. 
Veterans Affairs: House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller (R-Fla.), who is retiring from Congress, is the man most discussed for this job. 
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misidentified Jamie Dimon as the CEO of Goldman Sachs; he is the CEO of JP Morgan. A previous version of this article also misidentified Jeff Miller’s congressional district; he represents Florida and not California. This article has been updated to include Corey Lewandowski as a possible candidate.

WASHINGTON ― On Thursday, Democratic Party officials held their first staff meeting since Hillary Clinton ’s stunning loss to Donald Trump in the presidential race. It didn’t go well.
Donna Brazile, the interim leader of the Democratic National Committee, was giving what one attendee described as “a rip-roaring speech” to about 150 employees, about the need to have hope for wins going forward, when a staffer identified only as Zach stood up with a question.
“Why should we trust you as chair to lead us through this?” he asked, according to two people in the room. “You backed a flawed candidate, and your friend [former DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz] plotted through this to support your own gain and yourself.”
Some DNC staffers started to boo and some told him to sit down. Brazile began to answer, but Zach had more to say.
“You are part of the problem,” he continued, blaming Brazile for clearing the path for Trump’s victory by siding with Clinton early on. “You and your friends will die of old age and I’m going to die from climate change. You and your friends let this happen, which is going to cut 40 years off my life expectancy.”
Zach gathered his things and began to walk out. When Brazile called after him, asking where he was going, he told her to go outside and “tell people there” why she should be leading the party.
Two DNC staffers confirmed the exchange.
Asked for comment, Brazile said in an email, “As you can imagine, the individual involved is a member of the staff and I personally do not wish to discuss our internal meetings.”
A DNC spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
Brazile, a seasoned Democratic strategist, is the DNC’s interim chair until March 2017, when party officials hold a full DNC meeting to elect a new chair. Brazile has been filling in since July, when then-chair Wasserman Schultz stepped down after WikiLeaks released internal DNC emails showing party officials trying to help Clinton win the Democratic primary.
Brazile ran into her own bit of trouble in October when Wikileaks released emails showing that, in her role as a CNN strategist, she shared questions for CNN-sponsored candidate events in advance with friends on Clinton’s campaign.
Neither of the DNC staffers who spoke to HuffPost knew Zach’s last name, or much about him. They noted that he wasn’t alone in his sentiments. Some in the room nodded as he spoke, they said, and after he left, some talked about him being right on some points (perhaps not his claims about imminent death by climate change).
A third attendee told HuffPost that, despite Zach’s blow-up, there was “overwhelming” support for Brazile in the room. Her motivational words “had some staffers in tears,” per this attendee, and Brazile spoke to Zach’s concerns after he left. 
“If he had stayed, he would have heard that,” this person said.
Brazile could move to stay on as chair after March, but Thursday’s meeting shows at least some party officials want fresh blood at the top.
“The party is at a crossroads. They have been using the same playbook for decades, and now, they won’t let anyone else come in and change it up,” said one former longtime DNC staffer, who requested anonymity to speak freely. “The fact that Democrats just sat through a devastating defeat and now have to trust the leadership that not only contributed to Clinton’s loss, but the crushing 2014 midterm losses, well, what do they expect?”
This article has been updated to include comment from a third DNC meeting attendee.

David Halperin Attorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.org
Tuesday's election has produced a mixed result. Donald Trump won the voting in enough states to put him over the minimum 270 electoral vote threshold; with Michigan, Arizona, and New Hampshire still undecided, Trump is at 279 to 228 for Clinton. Hillary Clinton appears to have won the popular vote; at this hour she's up about 230,000 votes over Trump.
Clinton has conceded, and the Trump transition is moving ahead.
But the election isn't over, under our Constitution, until the designated electors of the Electoral College meet on December 19 at their state capitals to cast their votes and then, on January 6, Congress meets to affirm that result.
It would be an extraordinary measure for the electoral college to select anyone other than Donald Trump to be our next president.
This is an extraordinary situation.
Donald Trump is unfit to be president. Our current president has said Trump is unfit, as have many Republicans .  Trump has a remarkable record of bigotry , misogyny and sexual abuse , dishonesty , predatory business practices , misuse of charitable entities , and apparent pronounced narcissism . He has advocated for torture, bombing civilians, and other reckless acts that no conscientious military officer could carry out. Polls during the campaign showed that the vast majority of the public believe Trump is unfit and lacks the appropriate temperament to be president.
As Americans we have the right and indeed the duty to prevent an unfit person from taking the oath of office as our president.
We are not powerless to use our constitutional system to avoid disaster...  We have no obligation to sit back and do nothing.
Some have suggested that Clinton forces could recruit some Trump foes among the GOP electors to cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton, joining forces with the electors from states that Clinton won to give her an electoral college majority.
I think that goes too far.  The Trump-Pence GOP ticket won the electoral map vote.  The states, as weighted by their electoral votes, have said they want a change in Washington.
Moreover, if the electoral college took this extraordinary step, the Congress,  under our laws,  could still upset it . The GOP will control both houses of Congress. Which strengthens the case for pressing to replace Trump with a Republican, rather than Clinton.
Clinton electors and Republican electors concerned about Trump's fitness could join and select a different Republican -- perhaps Ohio governor John Kasich, New Mexico governor Susana Martinez, or Speaker of the House Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.
I supported Hillary Clinton. The GOP leaders I mentioned would likely advance policy outcomes I would strongly oppose. But I am looking for some solution that would protect our country from an unfit leader.
In our nation's history,  more than 99 percent of electors have voted as pledged  in the Electoral College. But electors are not required to do so.  A "" faithless elector "" has surfaced a number of times in our past - 157 times.  29 states bar faithless electors, so 21 states do not. Even in states where the practice is barred, the penalties can be light .
Folks, I know this is unlikely to happen.  All I am suggesting is that we are not powerless to use our constitutional system to avoid disaster.
Nearly 59 million Americans voted for Donald Trump, and many would be outraged and disappointed if he is not president. But at least at this writing, even more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton.  We have no obligation to sit back and do nothing.
In 1788, in the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton warned of the risks of inaugurating a president with""[t]alents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity,"" and he argued  for the proposed electoral college system in these terms: ""The process of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications."" Such a man stands on the verge of being inaugurated, but the process established by our Founders has not been completed.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) warned President-elect Donald Trump that “we will be his worst nightmare” if Trump directs the anger of his supporters toward Muslims, Hispanics, black people and women.
In a statement Wednesday, Sanders acknowledged that Trump “tapped into the anger of a declining middle class.” But on Thursday, Sanders issued a warning:
If Donald Trump takes people's anger and turns it against Muslims, Hispanics, African Americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare.
— Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) November 10, 2016
Sanders said he and other progressives are prepared to work with the president-elect on “pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country.”
The senator, who ran in the Democratic presidential primary before endorsing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , has long been a critic of Trump.
Trump visited Capitol Hill on Thursday for the first time as president-elect to meet with House Speaker Paul Ryan  (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

The president-elect's team has not yet agreed to having a protective pool during the transition period.

Michael Calderone Senior Media Reporter, The Huffington Post
President-elect Donald Trump broke with tradition on Thursday by heading to Washington, D.C., without a “protective pool” of journalists to cover his movements for the larger press corps. 
The White House Correspondents Association oversees a rotating pool system so that the president is always covered while traveling, especially in the event of historically significant or life-threatening moment. 
Neither Trump nor Hillary Clinton ’s campaign had a fully protective pool,  as opposed to recent major-party nominees. However, the Democrat’s system was close to the standard used in the White House. Trump didn’t fly with reporters, and sometimes didn’t notify them when he was leaving for events and even mocked them for being late. 
Last month, WHCA President Jeff Mason urged both presidential campaigns to agree to have a “protective pool” during the transitional period between the election and inauguration. Not doing so, he wrote, would be a “serious breach of historical precedent.”
Trump’s team hasn’t responded to the letter, Mason told The Huffington Post. 
In a statement, Mason said it’s “unacceptable” that there isn’t a pool of journalists traveling with the president-elect.
“The White House Correspondents’ Association is deeply concerned by President-elect Donald Trump’s decision to reject the practice of traveling with a ‘protective pool’ of reporters for his first visit to Washington since the election. In addition to breaking with decades of historical precedent and First Amendment principles, this decision could leave Americans blind about his whereabouts and well-being in the event of a national crisis. A pool of reporters is in place and ready to cover President-elect Trump. The WHCA urges President-elect Trump to allow it to do its job, including being present for motorcade movements, meetings, and other interactions. Not allowing a pool of journalists to travel with and cover the next president of the United States is unacceptable.”
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. However, she told Politico they “fully expect to operate a traditional pool and look forward to implementing our plans in the near future.”
 Trump flew Thursday from his home in New York to Washington to meet with President Barack Obama and other political leaders. There was no pool reporter with him during the flight or in his motorcade, a break with tradition for a president-elect. 
The White House pool currently covering Obama will be on hand to photograph the sitting president and the president-elect together after their discussion. But journalists weren’t on hand to bear witness their initial meeting.

Carly Ledbetter Entertainment Writer, The Huffington Post
Samantha Bee  kicked off her show with a passionate monologue on Wednesday’s episode of “Full Frontal” and criticized anyone who helped Donald Trump make it to the White House . 
“In the coming days, people will be looking for someone to blame: the pollsters, the strident feminists, the Democratic party, a vengeful god. But once you dust for fingerprints, it’s pretty clear who ruined America: white people. I guess ruining Brooklyn was just a dry run,” the late-night host said to rousing applause. “The Caucasian nation showed up in droves to vote for Trump, so I don’t want to hear a goddamn word about black voter turnout. How many times do we expect black people to build our country for us?”
“White people, this is the worst thing we’ve ever — no, I’m sorry, that’s a very high bar,” Bee said. “But holy shit, and don’t try to distance yourself from the bad apples and say, ‘It’s not my fault, I didn’t vote for him, hashtag not all white people.’ Shush. If Muslims have to take responsibility for every member of their community, so do we.” 
Electing the “marmalade hairball” and “vial of weaponized testosterone” sent a message to the U.S.’ allies and enemies all around the world, Bee said. But despite the hate that seems to have consumed our nation, the comedian ended her monologue with a message of hope. 
“We still have millions of nasty women who are not going away. And as long as women over 25 are still allowed on television, I’ll be here cheering them on. Although that may only be until late January,” Bee said, later adding, “Let’s get off the floor and get busy. Especially you white women ― we’ve got some karma to work off.”

Some might say that the Alt Right was bad for Trump . . . that we made his brand toxic . . . that we would have helped him more by just shutting up or even endorsing Hillary . . . that our first rule should have been, “Do no harm” . . . etc.
But to think in this way is to misunderstand everything.
Sam Francis noted that with both the Democratic and Republican Parties, the elites are to the left of the voters. Left-wing intellectuals, activists, and operatives are to the left (often far to the left) of the majority of Democrats (your average labor-union worker, soccer mom, or Black American). On the other hand, the Republican elite (the bowtie brigade, religious leaders, and “conservative intellectuals”) are also to the left of Republicans. Indeed, the Republican elite functions to dampen or deflect populist energies—to make sure things don’t “get out of hand” and that American nationalism is always about tax cuts.
In turn, the Alt Right (long before we had the name) was totally alienated from Republican politics. Postmodern deconstructionists and former left-wing terrorists with academic sinecures have a place in the official Left. People like Sam Francis were personae non gratae in the Right.
2016 changed all this.
The Alt Right is deeply connected to Trumpian populism in intellectual, spiritual, and visceral ways—for, as everyone agrees, Trump’s victory was, at its root, a victory of identity politics. And it was a campaign that ultimately dispensed with “conservatism” as we knew it. Because of this fact, Trump was opposed by most all components of the mainstream Right—from the neocons to establishment operatives to goofballs like Glenn Beck. And these forces opposed him with such vehemence that they simply cannot share in his victory.
In this way, the Alt Right, far more plausibly than the “conservative movement,” can lay claim to being the new Trumpian vanguard.
Before Trump, the Alt Right could be criticized for being a “head without a body”; it was engaged in meta-political and scientific discussion, but lacked a real connection with practical politics and the hopes and dreams of average Americans. In turn, Trump’s populism—with its half-baked policy ideas and sketchy vision of the future—could be criticized as a “body without a head.”
Now we are the whole man. The Alt Right and Trumpian populism are now aligned much in the way the Left is aligned with Democratic politicians like Obama and Hillary. The American Right always lacked a true vanguard. In the form of “conservatives,” it had only a “rearguard” or ""muffle” or “hall monitor.” We—and only we—can say the things Trump can’t say . . . can criticize him in the right way . . . and can envision a new world that he can’t quite grasp.
2016 wasn’t just a “weird election,” with a seemingly unelectable candidate who didn’t play by the rules. 2016 represents a paradigm shift of enormous proportions. We have been transfigured by it—and so has the world.",1

One need not reflect long on the state of contemporary America to appreciate the necessity of Donald J. Trump. Just as every construction must be preceded by a destruction in some form, Trump has taken aim at some of the most stubborn and ill-advised received wisdoms of the modern age. His candidacy has witnessed the shattering of taboo shibboleths on immigration and the ethos of American foreign policy.
Most significantly, the Trump campaign has brokered a new spirit of defiance among the White masses, brow-beaten and exhausted by the silent diktats of political correctness and a slavish adherence to the political status quo. Trump's 'truths' are, in a sense, revolutionary.
He has created a pathway for voters to openly acknowledge that their government is corrupt, that globalist interests have too much power, that law and order is a national priority, that they have a right to maintain the traditional character of their nation, and that in the sphere of foreign policy it is a moral good to place the interests of America first.
These 'truths' have been present in the corners of American political sub-culture for some time, but Trump's personality, perserverence, and resources have made them mainstream. Why Trump? Because he may just unlock the future we have all been striving for.",1

Leading up to the election, Radix Journal will publish a symposium, ""The Meaning of Trump,"" drawing writers from across the Alt Right. This is Occidental Observer/Quarterly 's editor Kevin MacDonald's entry.
The Alt Right has gravitated to Trump’s candidacy, and for good reason. Much of what the Alt Right wants will be difficult or impossible to bring about even with a president who is entirely on board with the idea that America should start thinking about the interests of its traditional White majority. But win or lose, Trump has already had a huge effect on American politics in a way that benefits the Alt Right:
Trump has made statements on immigration that have been banned from polite society for 50 years — deport illegals, seal the border, end birthright citizenship, place a moratorium on Muslim immigration, and make immigration serve actual labor needs rather than a moral imperative (ideally with guest workers not given citizenship). He has deplored Angela Merkel’s policies in Germany and has made statements indicating he opposes the transformation of Western societies via immigration and multiculturalism (“ Paris isn’t Paris anymore .”)
Trump has unmasked the neocons. The neocons have dominated the intellectual and foreign policy establishment of the Republican Party since the 1980s. From the beginning of Trump’s candidacy, neocons have been leading the #NeverTrump movement, despite the catastrophic effects of a Hillary Clinton presidency on the GOP. A Clinton presidency would ensure a liberal/left voting majority into the foreseeable future given that she would amnesty millions of illegals and dramatically raise total numbers of immigrants and refugees.  Clinton Supreme Court appointments would likely gut the First Amendment by enabling “hate speech” laws and they would gut the Second Amendment as well. No one on the right, from traditional “limited government”: conservatives to the Alt Right, would want this, and it’s difficult to believe that the Jewish identities and pro-Israel commitments of the most important neocons are lost on non-Jewish Republicans. The treason of the neocons will be long remembered in GOP circles and will compromise their influence in the future.
Trump has highlighted the chasm between the overwhelmingly White Republican voting base and the GOP donor class intent on globalist policies of mass immigration, free trade, and a bellicose pro-Israel, anti-Russian foreign policy. The pre-Trump GOP was dominated by a neocon foreign policy establishment and a pro-Chamber of Commerce, pro-big business economic policy. This party did not represent the interests of GOP voters and can’t be resurrected. Even if Trump loses, his energized supporters will be a new and important force within the GOP. Or they will support a new, explicitly populist party.
Trump has unmasked the media. The media has always been liberal, but this time around, even much of the usual pro-Republican media has been hostile to Trump, and a survey by the Media Research Center found an astounding 91% of media coverage hostile to his candidacy. This feeds into the narrative that there has been a unified establishment that has opposed Trump’s populist policies favoring the middle class and the traditional White majority.
Trump has put the Alt Right on the map. There have been numerous articles and commentary on the Alt Right because of Trump’s candidacy. The Alt Right has been the only identifiable intellectual perspective supporting Trump, although we understand that he is not one of us and would not attempt to do much what we would like to see in our ideal world. Much of the media coverage of the Alt Right was motivated by attempting to tar Trump as a “racist,” and after the election, win or lose, the media will likely attempt to put the toothpaste back in the tube by ceasing coverage. However, our increased visibility has meant a very large surge in support for the Alt Right. The future is bright, and a very large amount of the credit for that has to go to Donald Trump.",1

Leading up to the election, Radix Journal will publish a symposium, ""The Meaning of Trump,"" drawing writers from across the Alt Right. This is Cecilia Davenport 's entry
The rise of Donald Trump is a world-historical event. Since Trump came down that escalator, we’ve been living in a strange historical interlude; it has almost been as if he restarted history, but simultaneously somehow sped it all up. I think we all feel that, to some degree: the Current Era, dating from June 16, 2015, has brought new oddities and miracles every day, to which we one and all continue to exclaim, “What a time to be alive!” But the interlude ends soon. The British historian A.J.P Taylor famously called the failed revolution of 1848 “the turning point in history when history failed to turn.” No matter what the outcome of the election, history will turn in November 8th.
Why Trump? No one else could have done what he has done. Whether consciously or not, he did as Machiavelli advises in Chapter IX of The Prince. In discussing how to come to power, Machiavelli suggests that the best course for a new leader is to come to power with the help of the great, and then betray them, turning out to be a champion of the people. Because of this, they will be all the more grateful, because they didn’t expect anything from you. The people then perceive you to be acting freely, even though you may have long-term self interest in mind. This way you appear as the savior and liberator of the people against the great. Notice that Trump says in every speech, “I didn’t have to do this, folks.”
Now, Trump came from the world of the oligarchs, even though he elbowed his way into that as well; a boy from Queens, muscling his way into the world of Manhattan real estate. But when he entered the world of politics, recall that, at first, the elites couldn’t believe it. It took months for it to settle in that this campaign wasn’t an elaborate prank. That disbelief gave way to the attitude most in that class still seem to hold towards him: hatred and fear. They hate him because he betrayed them. They fear him not only because he might succeed, but because they think him mad. Only a madman would risk all of the status, the money, the powerful friends, the influence! Our apolitical managerial class of oligarchs can’t imagine another reason to risk all of those things. For what? Ambition? Greatness of soul? “Love of country?” You must be joking. Their minds can’t grasp the higher things.
Donald Trump has shown himself to be a remarkably political man. He is illiberal in a serious sense; he does not imagine politics to be a game. He understands at a gut level that the stakes are life and death: not just the life and death of individuals, but of nations. Leaving aside the sheer Caesarian force of will it must have taken, time and again, over the course of these months, to continue to consistently raise the issues of immigration, national sovereignty, and anti-globalism, even in the face of new pressures and attacks at every turn—Trump has created and sustained a significant popular movement of support. They love him. And he warmly and repeatedly insists that he loves them too.
But can he govern? Is America redeemable? I certainly didn’t think so before the Current Era. But as Ivanka said at the RNC, “Come January 17, all things will be possible again.” Trump will have to govern as he ran, like a Caesar. Like Caesar, he excels at theatrics and spectacle, and he must use this to sustain popular support, which will help ward off backstabbings and impeachment. The Trump rallies should continue; indeed, he should abolish the White House press corps and eliminate the media middle man, holding his press conferences before the people instead. He must continue to take the “slings and arrows” of the oligarchs (or, at least, appear to) on behalf of the people. He must continue to be their voice.
And what of us? We must become both Marc Antony and Octavian to his Caesar. In life, his loyal friend and advisor; in death, his champion and heir.
The Roman Republic needed Caesar to finish it off. There could be no Octavian without Caesar to clear the way. Just so, the Alt-Right needed Trump. Win or lose, history turns because of him.",1

Leading up to the election, Radix Journal will publish a symposium, ""The Meaning of Trump,"" drawing writers from across the Alt Right. This is Piero San Giorgio's entry.
I am what they call a ""survivalist"". As I explain in my books, I strive for an autonomous and free life for me and my family. I would not usually be concerned by the US presidential elections as any party would only accelerate the world demise into collapse and implosion.
This time is different.
Trump, is a sign of the possibility to – if not avoid, as the president does not have much power anyway – slow and perhaps even reverse the process that will inevitably lead to the collapse of the global economy, the social chaos and wars that will emerge and possibly the destruction of western civilization and the White peoples (or certainly massively reduce them in number and relevance). Even if Trump marginally loses or if the election is stolen or if some event precipitates chaos – the governing ""elites"" might prefer war and chaos to forfeiting their power – what the Trump campaign will have meant is that the people, abandoned by the financialized economy of Wall Street and the corrupt politicians of Washington and their minions in Brussels, the people forced to self-segregate to avoid crime, mixing and outright invasion from minorities (soon majorities in less than a generation), the people mocked and humiliated in the media, in the movies, by self-appointed pundits, by feminists, by so-called intellectuals… all these people realize that they represent a considerable part – perhaps the majority still – of the citizens and thus a considerable power.
A power with the ability to win with reasonable and peaceful argumentation, a power that refuses wars of conquest for foreign interests or wars to hide the failure of the current establishment and that could trigger nuclear annihilation, a power that will have to be reckoned with whatever happens, a power that will not accept humiliation and defeat, a power that might even fight if pushed beyond the current mental retrenchments. This alone, the awareness and the consolidation of this power is a major turning point in American and world history. History never stops, defeat and destruction are not inevitable, despite what many would like us all to believe. Trump will have achieved the recognition that we matter, that we can change history and he may well win, he must win. Then the real change could happen.
American friends do the right thing for your sake, for the White people’s sake, and for the world’s sake!",1
